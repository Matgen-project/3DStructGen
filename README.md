This program is a user-friendly and versatile program to view, build and edit organic molecules and crystal structures by using web standard techniques with HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. The atom, bond, angle and dihedral in a molecule can be viewed or modified by a mouse or other device. A wide range of cheminformatics algorithms for crystal structure are provided, such as cleaving surfaces, establishing vacuum layers, creating supercells, and the different displayed options for a unit cell. The initial input files for VASP and Gaussian can be obtained by interacting with dialog boxes in 3DStructGen.

The program is free and opensource to users, and has been released under MIT license.
